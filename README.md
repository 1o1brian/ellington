# Ellington

Named after [Duke Ellington](http://www.dukeellington.com/) whose signature tune was ["Take the 'A' Train"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Take_the_%22A%22_Train).
The song was written about [New York City's A train](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_%28New_York_City_Subway_service%29).

## Decomposing complex business processes

Ellington's nomenclature is taken from [New York's subway system](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City_Subway).
We've found that drawing parallels to the physical world helps us reason 
more clearly about the complexities of software.
