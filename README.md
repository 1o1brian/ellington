# Ellington

Named after [Duke Ellington](http://www.dukeellington.com/) whose signature tune was ["Take the 'A' Train"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Take_the_%22A%22_Train).
The song was written about [New York City's A train](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_%28New_York_City_Subway_service%29).

Ellington's nomenclature is taken from New York's subway system.
